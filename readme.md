When you save a Tiktok it saves one of two ways:
- 1/30 fps audio desync and a 4 second tiktok splash screen
- 4/30 fps audio desync and no splash screen

This program captures a frame of the video and detects the splash screen status. Then splitting the audio track, and using editly to generate a new video with corrected audio and no splash screen.

The generated video is now ready to be reuploaded to other platforms.
